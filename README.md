## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.






# dont forget to make an .env file and add the line ''' FOOTBALL_API_KEY ="your api key" '''

it seemed to me that adding authentication here would make the experience worse since to see the score you would have to authenticate it which would result in lower click rates thus i have implemented an another repository to show authentication on e-commerce website. repo link- https://github.com/KrishnaAgarwal1308/ieeeprojectpart2
